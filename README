Precompiled Razor Views

This project contains tools and base classes for using Razor views in scenarios where standard ASP.NET MVC 3 is not an option.

 * Use cshtml to generate view code that can run without .NET 4.0
 * Use standard Razor views without a dependency on the server having a working Razor BuildProvider
 * Compile shared views into a seperate assembly
 * Use Razor views and MVC concepts to build SharePoint web parts
